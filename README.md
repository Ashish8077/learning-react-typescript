## Note About Code Quality and Learning

This repository contains code written while learning React and TypeScript. Some code may not follow best practices or may be experimental, as the main goal is to understand concepts and practice new skills.

If you are a recruiter or reviewer:
- Please consider that this code reflects my learning journey.
- Code quality may improve over time as I gain more experience.
- The presence of mistakes or non-optimal solutions shows my willingness to experiment and learn from errors.

I believe sharing my learning process on GitHub demonstrates:
- My commitment to learning new technologies.
- My ability to document progress and reflect on improvements.
- My openness to feedback and growth.

Thank you for understanding!
